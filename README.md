## React or Vue or Angular?

I will be figuring out which framework/library to learn!

What I know so far:
- React seems to be very popular
- Vue has a small learning curve
- Angular is tough

Let's begin :)

- finished React and Vue app
- I enjoy React more than Vue
- it is obvious that Vue is better than React for small scale projects
- I am looking forwards to creating an Angular app :)
