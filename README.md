## React or Vue or Angular?

I will be figuring out which framework/library to learn!

What I know so far:
- React seems to be very popular
- Vue has a small learning curve
- Angular is tough

Let's begin :)

December 11th 2020
- Finished React, Vue, and Angular app
- They are all super cool!
- Vue does have a small learning curve
- Angular was easier than I expected
- I will focus my time on learning React due to the popularity
  - Vue and Angular weren't outstanding enough to convince me to use them over the way more popular React library
  - I will continue to spend some time learning Vue because I think it will be very good for smaller projects
